When we started using CosmosDB it was still called DocumentDB. At that time the support was very limited. We delayed our usage of oData as much as possible in hope to receive an oData package from Microsoft.

After we realized that it is unlikely for Microsoft to support oData for CosmosDb, I thought ok, we will get this package and build on top of it. I couldn't get a PR approved to the original repository because the original author is not responding therefore, I forked it. But it's proven to be more challenging that I originally thought. 

It turned out that there are heaps of features missing from this code-base and IMHO it's not written in the prettiest way possible. It's also based on .Net 4.6.2 which means no support for .Net Core 2 or .Net Standard 2.

We are using this package internally. Every time something doesn't work based on our new models and findings, I will jump in and add that missing feature. 

The development on this package is very "patchy" so to speak. My aim is to add the missing features in the shortest amount of time possible with the least effort. Sometimes by implementing a missing override and another time by adding some ugly RegEx to reformat the output. 

Please be aware of the situation and use this package at your own risk.

PRs are welcome.

## Summary

This package supports most of the intersectional functionalities provided by OData V4 and DocumentDB SQL. For example, if you have a class looks like:
```
public class Company {
  public string englishName,
  public string countryCode,
  public int    revenue
}
```
To query all companies whose englishName contains "Limited", and sort them by countryCode in descending order, then select the revenue property from top 5 results, you can issue an OData query to your web service:
```
http://localhost/Company?$select=revenue&$filter=contains(englishName, 'Limited')&$orderby=countryCode desc&$top=5
```
The above query will then be translated to DocumentDB SQL:
```
SELECT TOP 5 c.revenue FROM c WHERE CONTAINS(c.englishName,'Limited') ORDER BY c.countryCode DESC 
```

### Supported OData to DocumentDB SQL mappings:

```

## Usage

After installation, you can include the binary in your \*.cs file by
```
using Microsoft.Azure.Documents.OData.Sql;
```
-You can find a complete set of examles in [ODataToSqlSamples.cs](https://github.com/aboo/azure-documentdb-odata-sql/blob/master/azure-documentdb-odata-sql-samples/ODataToSqlSamples.cs)-

There are only two classes you need to work with in order to get the translation done: [SQLQueryFormatter](https://github.com/aboo/azure-documentdb-odata-sql/blob/master/azure-documentdb-odata-sql/ODataToSqlTranslator/SqlQueryFormatter.cs) and [ODataToSqlTranslator]https://github.com/aboo/azure-documentdb-odata-sql/blob/master/azure-documentdb-odata-sql/ODataToSqlTranslator/ODataToSqlTranslator.cs). 
#### SQLQueryFormatter
SQLQueryFormatter is where we do the property and function name translation, such as translating 'propertyName' to 'c.propertyName', or 'contains()' to 'CONTAINS()'. This class inherits from [QueryFormatterBase](https://github.com/aboo/azure-documentdb-odata-sql/blob/master/azure-documentdb-odata-sql/ODataToSqlTranslator/QueryFormatterBase.cs), which abstractly defines all required translations. One can derive from QueryFormatterBase to implement their own translation per need.

#### ODataToSqlTranslator
ODataToSqlTranslator does the overall translation, by taking in an implementation of QueryFormatterBase. Because the specific translation is defined in QueryFormatter, the translation performs differently according to the implementation in QueryFormatter. 
The default QueryFormatter is SQLQueryFormatter mentioned above:
```
var oDataToSqlTranslator = new ODataToSqlTranslator(new SQLQueryFormatter());
```
Once we have an instance of ODataToSqlTranslator, we can call .Translate(ODataQueryOptions, TranslateOptions, string) method:
```
var translatedSQL = oDataToSqlTranslator.(oDataQueryOptions, TranslateOptions.ALL, additionalWhereClause: null);
```
In the above example, the [ODataQueryOptions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.http.odata.query.odataqueryoptions(v=vs.118).aspx) is a fundamental class provided by ASP.NET [Web API 2](https://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/odata-support-in-aspnet-web-api/supporting-odata-query-options), there you can find detailed instruction on ODataQueryOptions. Additionally, you can also find ODataQueryOptions usage in the ODataToSqlSamples file. 
The second parameter is TranslateOptions, which defines what queries to be translated. Define TranslateOptions are:
```
SELECT_CLAUSE, JOIN_CLAUSE, WHERE_CLAUSE, ORDERBY_CLAUSE, TOP_CLAUSE, ALL
```
The options can be combined with bit operators such as ```(TranslateOptions.SELECT_CLAUSE | TranslateOptions.WHERE_CLAUSE)```. One common usage is ```(TranslateOptions.ALL & ~TranslateOptions.TOP)```, this combination enables all translation but TOP. The reason to disable TOP is that when performing pagination, DocumentDB ignores [continuation token in FeedOptions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.azure.documents.client.feedoptions.requestcontinuation.aspx) if TOP exists. Therefore, the best practice is to use ```FeedOptions``` to perform TOP operation in DocumentDB.
